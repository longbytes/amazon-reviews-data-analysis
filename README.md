## Project Description
In this analysis, we aim to gain valuable insights from Amazon customer reviews data. These insights can help Amazon to optimize its recommendation algorithms and enhance the overall customer experience on its platform.

## Key Business Questions
1. Who are the high-potential users should Amazon recommend products to?
2. Which products should Amazon prioritize for promotion and recommendation?
3. Is there any difference between purchasing behaviour of frequent buyers and not frequent buyers?
4. Who usually gave more lengthy reviews between frequent and infrequent users?
